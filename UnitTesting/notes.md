- we can share fixture among multiples test using
    - `@depends` that will get input from `provider` test functions
    - using `static setUpBeforeClass` that will be executed be executed before test class.
    - if we want to stubs some of the methods not the all, then have to use `getMockBuilder` `$this->getMockBuilder(class::class)->setMethods(null)` will not set any method on the stub
    - there are two ways we can test protected functions
        - using inheritence by changing the accessibity to public
        - using `Reflection`
